Class cirbuild
most of the methods are gates
Initially when the the class is called (with input being number of qubits in the system), all the qubits are initialized to zero.

Qubit numbering as input for gates starts from 0.

Available gates:
X gate: x(input qubit number)
Y gate: y()
Z gate: z()
Hadamard gate: h()

Rotational gates:
along x axis    rx(qubit,angle to be rotated by in degrees)
along y axis    ry('')
along z axis    rz('')

phase gate:     p(qubit,angle to rotate th phase by in degrees)

cnot gate: cx(control qubit, target qubit)
control z gate: cz(control qubit, target qubit)
ccnot gate: ccx(control qubit 1, control qubit 2, target qubit)

circ_state() method provides the total current possible states of the system as a linear combination

probs() method provides the probabilities of the possible states of the system

cmatrix() method shows the current column matrix of the qubits which holds all the possible states for a set of qubits (initialized during the beinging)
states() shows all the possible combination/ states possible for the initialized set of qubits
plot() method gives the plot of the probabilities of possible qubit states
